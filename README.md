# pacman
A recreation of Namco's classic arcade game, Pac-Man (1980), written in C++.

**GAMEPLAY**

• The aim of the game is to eat all of the little dots, while gaining as many points as possible.  
• The player starts the game with 3 lives and they lose the game if all 3 lives have been lost.  
• A life is lost each time contact is made with an invulnerable ghost.  
• Ghosts are temporarily made vulnerable by contacting one of the large flashing dots (power pellets).  
• Capturing ghosts grants points; additional points are granted for capturing multiple in the same power pellet usage.  
• Captured ghosts retreat back to their base, where they are immediately revived.  
• The player and ghosts can teleport across the map using the tunnels on the left and right of them map.  

**CONTROLS**

**CREDIT**

This project was created in 2023 as a part of a company's hiring process, where I was given poorly written, broken and unfinished skeleton code and I had to complete the solution.  

All images were created by me, but using the original sprite designs and colours from the original game.  

The font was sourced online and is freely available for use in personal projects. The font can be found here: https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2229237/arcade-legacy-1  

***I received explicit permission from the company to add this project to my portfolio.***
