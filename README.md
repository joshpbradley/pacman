# Pac-Man Recreation
A recreation of Namco's classic arcade game, Pac-Man (1980), written in C++.

**GAMEPLAY**

• The aim of the game is to eat all of the little dots in the level, while gaining as many points as possible.  
• The player starts the game with 3 lives and they lose the game if all 3 lives have been lost.  
• A life is lost each time contact is made with an invulnerable ghost.  
• Ghosts are temporarily made vulnerable by contacting one of the large flashing dots (power pellets).  
• Capturing ghosts grants points; additional points are granted for capturing multiple in the same power pellet usage.  
• Captured ghosts retreat back to their base, where they are immediately revived.  
• The player and ghosts can teleport across the map using the tunnels on the left and right of the map.  

**CONTROLS**
